"@nestm/mcp": patch
---

Declare `@nestm/mcp-auth` as a runtime dependency so production installs can import the built Nest
module's OAuth integration without relying on development dependencies. Add a first-class
`@nestm/mcp/client` entrypoint for outbound-only Nest applications without loading inbound server,
gateway, or OAuth implementation code.
