# @nestm/mcp-observability

Backend-neutral observability for NestM MCP clients, servers, and gateways. The package consumes the operation and lifecycle contracts from `@nestm/mcp-core`; it does not depend on a logging, metrics, or tracing SDK.

## Install

```sh
pnpm add @nestm/mcp-observability@alpha
```

## Safety defaults

Automatic telemetry contains only bounded protocol dimensions: runtime role, operation name and kind, capability, and (optionally) the named target. Principal data, operation payloads, arbitrary context attributes, operation/request/session IDs, error messages, stacks, tokens, cookies, and credentials are excluded by default.

String length, key length, and attribute count have hard upper bounds. Additional dimensions require an explicit `selectAttributes` hook, and sensitive-looking keys require a second `allowSensitiveAttribute` decision. Use `redactAttribute` to hash, bucket, normalize, or drop values before export.

## Lifecycle observers

```ts
import { composeMcpLifecycleObservers } from "@nestm/mcp-core";
import { createMcpLoggerObserver, createMcpMetricsObserver } from "@nestm/mcp-observability";

const observer = composeMcpLifecycleObservers([
	createMcpLoggerObserver({
		write: ({ level, message, attributes }) => logger[level](attributes, message),
	}),
	createMcpMetricsObserver({
		record: (measurements) => metrics.record(measurements),
	}),
]);
```

The logger emits one immutable structured record per lifecycle event. Failures include only `error.type` and an optional `error.code`. The metrics observer emits batches for started/completed counters, active operations, and duration in milliseconds.

Pass the composed observer to the `lifecycleObserver` option of a NestM runtime. Runtime lifecycle middleware treats observers as best-effort, so telemetry outages do not replace MCP results or errors.

## Mergeable duration statistics

`McpDurationHistogram` is value-level arithmetic for process-local and durable hosts. Configure
strictly increasing nonnegative upper bounds with a final `Infinity` bucket. `create`, `record`,
`merge`, and `summarize` share the collector's saturating count/sum and bounded percentile semantics.
Durations may be fractional; display rounding stays with the host.

```ts
import { McpDurationHistogram } from "@nestm/mcp-observability";

const histogram = new McpDurationHistogram([5, 10, 100, Infinity]);
const current = histogram.create();
histogram.record(current, 8);
const serialized = JSON.stringify(histogram.snapshot(current));
const restored = histogram.restore(JSON.parse(serialized));
histogram.merge(current, restored);
console.log(histogram.summarize(current));
```

Snapshots retain count, sum, maximum, and bins. Their versioned geometry uses `null` for the
unbounded bucket so JSON round trips remain exact. `restore` rejects incompatible bounds and
invalid counts before returning detached mutable state. Direct data merging is available to
hosts whose existing storage schema already pins the histogram geometry. The host owns record
deduplication, dimensions, persistence and time buckets; merging the same history twice counts it
twice. `addMcpMetricCount` exposes the same nonnegative safe-integer saturation for other counters.

## Fixed-memory metrics

For a process-local dashboard or a small deployment without a metrics SDK, the package includes a
framework-neutral collector for the canonical batches emitted by `createMcpMetricsObserver`:

```ts
import {
	McpFixedMemoryMetricsCollector,
	createMcpMetricsObserver,
} from "@nestm/mcp-observability/metrics";

const metrics = new McpFixedMemoryMetricsCollector();
const observer = createMcpMetricsObserver(metrics);

const snapshot = metrics.snapshot();
const prometheus = metrics.renderPrometheus();
```

`McpMetricsSnapshot` contains lifetime totals, bounded operation groups, and a fixed 15-minute
window of 60 15-second buckets. Durations use exported fixed histogram bounds; `p50Ms` and `p95Ms`
are bin estimates clamped by the observed maximum. Snapshots are deeply frozen and exclude targets,
identifiers, inputs, outputs, and errors. When the operation-group bound is reached, later dimensions
are folded into one `other` group per runtime role and operation kind.

The collector accepts only exact, internally consistent default measurement batches. Partial,
renamed, malformed, out-of-range, or mismatched batches are ignored atomically. Its memory use is
fixed by `MCP_METRICS_BUCKET_COUNT`, `MCP_METRICS_HISTOGRAM_BOUNDS_MS`, and
`MCP_METRICS_MAX_OPERATION_GROUPS`.

## Structural tracing

```ts
import { createMcpTracingMiddleware } from "@nestm/mcp-observability/tracing";

const tracing = createMcpTracingMiddleware({
	startSpan: (name, options) => myTracer.startSpan(name, options),
	withSpan: (span, callback) => myTracer.withActiveSpan(span, callback),
});
```

Implement the small `McpTracer` and `McpTraceSpan` interfaces for OpenTelemetry or another backend. Spans receive safe bounded attributes and static failure status text. Raw exception recording is deliberately off; use the explicit `recordError` hook when the backend's data policy permits messages and stacks.

Tracing backend failures are reported through `onInstrumentationError` and are contained so they cannot replace an operation result or primary error.

## Attribute policy

```ts
const projection = {
	selectAttributes: (context) => ({
		"tenant.bucket": bucketTenant(context),
	}),
	redactAttribute: ({ key, value }) => {
		if (key === "tenant.bucket") return hash(String(value));
		return typeof value === "string" ? value : undefined;
	},
};
```

Avoid dimensions with unbounded cardinality such as user IDs, URLs, prompts, resource contents, and request/session identifiers. Prefer stable buckets for metrics and logs, and keep direct correlation data in an explicitly governed tracing backend.
