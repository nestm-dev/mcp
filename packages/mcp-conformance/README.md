A framework-neutral orchestration and report kernel for repeatable runtime integrity probes against
an MCP server you do not control.

The package executes a host-defined, ordered plan against an ephemeral target and produces a
bounded immutable report. It deliberately does not own transports, endpoints, credentials,
connections, persistence, baseline approval, or dashboard policy. Those stay in the host that
already owns the MCP runtime generation.

## Install

```sh
pnpm add @nestm/mcp-conformance
```

## Define and run a plan

```ts
import { defineMcpConformancePlan, runMcpConformancePlan } from "@nestm/mcp-conformance";

interface Target {
	ping(signal: AbortSignal): Promise<void>;
}

declare const target: Target;

const plan = defineMcpConformancePlan<Target>({
	id: "safe-discovery",
	version: "1",
	title: "Safe discovery",
	checks: [
		{
			id: "protocol.ping",
			title: "Protocol ping",
			risk: "read-only",
			async run({ target, signal }) {
				await target.ping(signal);
				return { status: "pass", code: "PING_OK" };
			},
		},
	],
});

const report = await runMcpConformancePlan(plan, {
	target,
	runId: crypto.randomUUID(),
	descriptor: {
		target: { kind: "connection", id: "fixture-a", revision: 3, generation: 2 },
		subject: { name: "@nestm/mcp", version: "0.1.0-alpha.4" },
	},
});
```

Checks run one at a time. Side-effecting checks are skipped unless `allowSideEffects: true` is
explicitly set. Caller cancellation and bounded run/check timeouts are propagated through the
check signal. A check may return `error` with a stable infrastructure code; otherwise thrown errors
are converted to `CHECK_THREW`. Error messages, stacks, inputs, and outputs never enter the report.
Observer callbacks are best-effort notifications: returned promises are deliberately not awaited,
so telemetry cannot delay checks or defeat run bounds.

The target adapter must propagate each check's `signal` into its underlying network, runtime, and
lease operations. A timeout bounds how long the runner waits; it cannot forcibly stop work that
ignores cancellation. Hosts should compose the check signal with generation-retirement and shutdown
signals, make adapter cleanup idempotent, and release the underlying lease only after cooperative
work has settled.

`descriptor.subject` records the build of the observing client that produced the report, not the
server under test; the observed server is `descriptor.target`.

## Serialize a report

```ts
import {
	parseMcpConformanceReportJson,
	serializeMcpConformanceReport,
} from "@nestm/mcp-conformance";

const json = serializeMcpConformanceReport(report);
const parsed = parseMcpConformanceReportJson(json);
```

JSON parsing, runner output, and serialization use a 1 MiB default report limit. Trusted hosts that
need a larger report may set `limits.maxJsonBytes` on the runner and pass
`{ maximumBytes: value }` to JSON parsing or serialization, up to the 4 MiB hard limit. Fingerprint
inputs are capped at 8 MiB, 128 levels, and 100,000 JSON nodes before canonical sorting.

## Capture untrusted values and digest a catalog

`canonicalizeMcpConformanceValue` enforces only its own fixed ceilings (8 MiB, 128 levels, 100,000
nodes, 50,000 properties per object) and walks a hostile shape on the way there.
`captureMcpConformanceValue` refuses the shape instead. It copies an untrusted value into
deep-frozen, null-prototype JSON data under caller-supplied bounds, rejecting proxies, accessor and
non-enumerable properties, symbol keys, sparse or subclassed arrays, exotic prototypes, cycles, and
non-finite numbers. `undefined` follows the canonicalizer's own JSON semantics by default, so a
captured value always canonicalizes exactly like its source. Pass `{ undefinedPolicy: "reject" }` as
the third argument when omission from objects or conversion to `null` in arrays must be refused.

```ts
import {
	captureMcpConformanceValue,
	captureMcpToolArguments,
	digestMcpRuntimeCatalog,
	toMcpConformanceFingerprintHex,
	type McpConformanceCatalogSnapshot,
} from "@nestm/mcp-conformance";

declare const untrusted: unknown;
declare const catalog: McpConformanceCatalogSnapshot;

const limits = {
	maxBytes: 262_144,
	maxDepth: 24,
	maxProperties: 8_192,
	maxStringBytes: 32_768,
	maxItems: 512,
};

const value = captureMcpConformanceValue(untrusted, limits);
const arguments_ = captureMcpToolArguments(untrusted, limits);
const strictArguments = captureMcpToolArguments(untrusted, limits, {
	undefinedPolicy: "reject",
});

const digest = digestMcpRuntimeCatalog(catalog, {
	domain: "acme/mcp/catalog/v1",
	toolSchemaDomain: "acme/mcp/tool-schema/v1",
	limits,
});
const hexadecimal = toMcpConformanceFingerprintHex(digest.catalogFingerprint);
```

Bounds are resolved against `MCP_CONFORMANCE_DEFAULT_CAPTURE_LIMITS` and
`MCP_CONFORMANCE_HARD_CAPTURE_LIMITS` by `resolveMcpConformanceCaptureLimits`. A refusal is an
`McpConformanceCaptureError` whose `code` states the structural reason; messages never quote the
rejected value, its keys, or the limit that was reached.

`captureMcpToolArguments` layers a `Readonly<Record<string, unknown>>` argument record on the same
capture. Both capture functions accept `McpConformanceCaptureOptions` as their third argument;
`undefinedPolicy` is `"json"` by default and may be set to `"reject"` to refuse an `undefined` value
at any depth. Byte accounting is predictive — every node spends exactly the canonical JSON bytes it
will later serialize to, so an oversized payload is refused before it is materialized — and the
prediction is then cross-checked against `canonicalizeMcpConformanceValue`'s exact output byte
length. A fence that failed to hold rejects the arguments instead of passing them on.

`digestMcpRuntimeCatalog` accepts a catalog structurally, by its `tools`, `resources`,
`resourceTemplates`, and `prompts` collections, so a runtime manager's catalog snapshot satisfies it
without this kernel depending on a runtime package. It returns one `catalogFingerprint` plus a
per-tool `schemaDigest`, letting a management path and a serving path compare the same surface.
Both domains are caller-supplied and validated with the fingerprint domain rule. Discovery order
never reaches a digest: each collection is sorted on its identity (`name`, `uri`, or `uriTemplate`)
with a canonical-form tiebreak, and a repeated identity is refused rather than silently collapsed.

Fingerprints keep the package's `sha256:<base64url>` form. `toMcpConformanceFingerprintHex` renders
one as 64 lowercase hexadecimal characters, so a digest column with a fixed-width hexadecimal
`CHECK` can store it without hand-rolled transcoding.

## Project an untrusted tool result

`projectMcpToolResult` is the lossy output boundary for a `tools/call` result. Text blocks remain
bounded text; image, audio, embedded-resource, resource-link, unknown, and future blocks become
descriptor-only summaries. Their data, URIs, and other fields are never copied. Structured content
is rebuilt as frozen null-prototype JSON under depth, node, string, and serialized-byte limits.
Every omitted, malformed, hostile, or truncated value sets the result's `truncated` flag.

```ts
import { projectMcpToolResult } from "@nestm/mcp-conformance";

declare const untrustedToolResult: unknown;

const projected = projectMcpToolResult(untrustedToolResult, {
	maxContentBlocks: 20,
	maxTextBytesPerBlock: 8_192,
	maxTextBytesTotal: 65_536,
	maxStructuredDepth: 8,
	maxStructuredNodes: 1_000,
	maxStructuredStringBytes: 16_384,
	maxStructuredSerializedBytes: 65_536,
	maxSummaryDescriptorLength: 128,
});
```

Omit the limits to use the same conservative defaults shown above. Fixed hard ceilings still apply
to caller overrides. Proxies, accessors, exotic prototypes, cycles, sparse entries, symbol keys,
non-finite numbers, and `__proto__` members are dropped without invoking source getters.
`degradedMcpToolResult` supplies an immutable empty fallback when a host deliberately catches a
projection failure at a wider boundary.

## Safety boundary

Facts are restricted to bounded scalar values. Sensitive-looking fact keys are omitted, strings
are truncated, and caught exception details are never serialized. A host should still author plans
as trusted code and must not deserialize executable checks or accept arbitrary operations from a
dashboard request.
